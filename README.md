# vit
This project includes implementations of ResNet and ViT. In addition, it includes a ResNet + Attention (a simple hybrid model).

# Datasets
In this implementations we use datasets in TFDS format. As an examen, we have a dataset of sketchs (from TUI-BERLIN) stored in TFDS. You can download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2solxdfth188dug5bjqia/tfds_skberlin.tar?rlkey=2m0mhnvzugb86ovafwrr09kld&dl=0).

You will need to untar the dataset into $(HOME)/tensorflow_datasets  (this is the folder (by default) where the system looks for tfds datasets).
